# Changes Log

## 2025-05-22 - File Handling Improvements

### Added

- **File Utilities Module**: Created a new `utils` package with `file_utils.py` containing robust file handling functions
- **CSV Verification Tool**: Added `verify_csv_files.py` script to check and repair CSV files
- **Backup System**: Added automatic creation of backups when overwriting files
- **Unique Filename Generation**: System now creates timestamped filenames when files already exist
- **CSV Validation**: Added validation for all generated CSV files

### Changed

- **File Move Operations**: Enhanced `combine_csv_files()` to safely handle existing files
- **File Creation Logic**: Improved file creation with better error handling
- **Error Handling**: Added specific error handling for file operations
- **Cleanup Process**: Added automatic cleanup for temporary and partially created files

### Fixed

- **File Overwrite Issue**: Fixed the `[WinError 183] Cannot create a file when that file already exists` error
- **File Closing**: Ensured proper closing of files in error cases
- **Indentation Issues**: Fixed indentation problems in scraper modules
- **Incomplete Files**: Added validation to prevent incomplete files from being used

## 2025-05-21 - Initial Structure Improvements

### File Structure Changes

1. Organized code into three main packages:
   - `main/`: Core functionality
   - `scrapers/`: Website-specific scrapers
   - `duplicate_utils/`: Duplicate detection logic

2. Created proper package structure:
   - Added `__init__.py` files to each package
   - Updated imports to use the package structure

3. Created additional scripts for better usability:
   - `run_scraper.py`: New clean entry point
   - `test_imports.py`: Script to verify imports
   - `test_integration.py`: Script to test integration
   - `README.md`: Documentation for the project

## Import Fixes

1. Updated `__init__.py` files to expose the right functions:
   - `main/__init__.py`: Exposes the `main` function
   - `scrapers/__init__.py`: Exposes website-specific scrapers
   - `duplicate_utils/__init__.py`: Exposes `DuplicateChecker`

2. Fixed relative imports in the duplicate utilities:
   - Changed `from duplicate_checker import ...` to `from .duplicate_checker import ...`

3. Added dry-run functionality:
   - Allows testing the scraper without actually scraping
   - Shows what would be scraped

## What Was Learned

1. Python package structure is important for organizing code
2. Proper relative imports are critical for maintainability
3. Testing scripts help verify functionality
4. Documentation improves understanding of the codebase
5. Clean entry points make using the tool easier

## Next Steps

1. Implement a proper logging system instead of print statements
2. Add more configuration options via command-line arguments or config file
3. Add tests for the file handling utilities
4. Consider adding a graphical interface
5. Expand to more scholarship websites
6. Consider implementing data validation for scraped content
